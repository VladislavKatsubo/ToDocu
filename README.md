# ToDocu: A Simple Yet Effective To-Do List App

## Description

ToDocu is an iOS application that serves as a straightforward, efficient to-do list manager. It's an exemplar of clean, maintainable code built using MVVM+C architecture, SOLID principles, Dependency Injection, and UIKit.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add new tasks easily with a streamlined, user-friendly interface.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete with a simple tap, visually tracking your progress.
- **Task Deletion**: Effortlessly remove tasks by swiping left, keeping your to-do list uncluttered.

## Codebase

The ToDocu codebase is written in Swift and heavily focused on maintainability and reusability:

- **MVVM+C**: The project utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator (MVVM+C) architectural pattern, which separates responsibilities into clear layers. This approach facilitates testability and simplifies the process of maintaining and scaling the codebase.
- **SOLID Principles**: The code follows SOLID principles to ensure it's easily understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependency Injection is used throughout the app, making the code more modular, testable, and decoupled.
- **Reusable Views**: The UI is constructed using reusable views, promoting code reusability and consistency across the application.
- **UIKit**: The UI is built using UIKit, making the app robust and ensuring a high level of control over UI elements.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
